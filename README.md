# Sales Data Analysis

### Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the sales performance of an E-commerce company over the the period of past 4 years. By analysing various aspects of the sales data, we seek to identify trends, make data driven recommendations and gain a deeper understanding of the company's performance.

### Tools 
Microsoft Power BI - Data Cleaning, Analysis and creating reports

### Exploratory Data Analysis
1. Calculate total sales?
2. Analyze sales trends over time?
3. Determine the best-selling products?

### Results

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1. Overall sales: With total sales at $12.64 million, it appears to be a fruitful period for the company.
2. Top Selling item: The Apple Smart Phone full size being the top seller (at $86.9K) indicates a strong demand for high-end products.
3. High volume, low margin: While Staples have the most orders (876) with almost 43% of the total products ordered, they likely have a lower profit margin compared to the Apple Smart phones.
4. New York City a top performer: New York being the city with the highest sales(3417) and orders demonstrates the importance of this market.
Sales on the rise: The increasing sales trend over time is a positive indicator for the company's growth.
